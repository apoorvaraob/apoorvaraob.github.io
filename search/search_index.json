Design and implement scalable solutions that stand up to the scrutiny of external regulators and inspection by AWS's most security-sensitive customers. Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of software engineers, security engineers, technical product/program managers, data engineers, and compliance specialists to build customer trust through innovative security solutions. Software Development Engineer and Research Engineer Applied AI - Amazon Worldwide Stores August 2022 - January 2025 Bellevue, WA Identified customer pain points, explored relevant recent research addressing similar challenges, developed proof of concept or minimally viable/lovable product, iterated on prototype, and conducted user acceptance tests for Human-in-the-loop tools like Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) and AWS Sagemaker Groundtruth for Prime Air data annotations. Developed a geocode verification prototype using AWS Bedrock Agents that mirrors auditor workflows by integrating external APIs (Bing, ESRI, HereMaps) for Last Mile Analytics. The initial phase achieved promising accuracy and recall on curated groundtruth data, helping shape the future project roadmap. Led comprehensive security and privacy reviews for handling classified customer data to meet industry compliance standards Earned the \"Mission Impossible\" award for rapidly building customer trust through security implementations with agile. Managed service-level security certifications for a 40+ person organization and shared best practices across teams. Additionally, implemented security measures for a worldwide fulfillment center stowing and shelf recognition automation project, contributing to an $8.8MM YoY reduction in cost to serve. Co-led product development for SmartSifting, a model training accelerator library achieving up to 35% efficiency gains, through creating whitepapers, presentations, press releases, and FAQs. Incorporated private beta feedback from major AWS customers to improve user experience before launching in the AWS Sagemaker Deep Learning Container. Cut experimentation setup time by 50% for science teams working on AI agents by implementing an experiment harness on AWS Sagemaker Studio and providing targeted documentation.
